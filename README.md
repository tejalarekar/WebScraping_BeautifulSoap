Data Extraction from Web  

Web scraping-
Web scraping is the process of automating the extraction of information from websites. It involves making HTTP requests to a website's server, downloading HTML data, and then parsing this data to extract the information you need. This information can then be saved to a file or database for later use. Web scraping is commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as data mining, data analysis, and information gathering.

Beautiful Soup-
Beautiful Soup is a Python library for web scraping. It is used for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. Beautiful Soup automatically converts incoming documents to Unicode and outgoing documents to UTF-8. It sits on top of an HTML or XML parser, providing Python methods for accessing data in a parse tree. The library provides methods to search, navigate, and modify a parse tree, making it easy to extract the data you need from HTML and XML files. Beautiful Soup is commonly used in combination with other libraries, such as Requests, to perform web scraping tasks in a more convenient and efficient way.
